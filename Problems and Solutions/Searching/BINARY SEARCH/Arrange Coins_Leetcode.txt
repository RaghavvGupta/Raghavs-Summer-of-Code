441. Arranging Coins
Easy


You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.


class Solution {
public:
    int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long long coins_used = 0;
        int rows = 0;
        for(int i = 1; coins_used <= n ; i++){
            coins_used += i;
            if(coins_used <= n){
                rows++;
            }
            
        }
    return rows;
    }
    
};
